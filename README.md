This is a research done using personal loans data from Prosper, a P2P lending institution from US. The data is publicly available and can downloaded from https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv.

The study entailed fitting the generalised gamma regression cure rate model to complete cases (CC) data, then using MICE to impute missing values on the variable "debt-to-income ratio" and remodelling again. This is done to underscore the need to use a principled approach to data imputation in order to prevent unbiased estimates, ensure completeness of analysis, and comply with data standards that require datasets to meet specific requirements for missing values.
